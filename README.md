Experiments with a GCC plugin for GLib
======================================

This tries to implement the `g_tuple` attribute that will take a bunch of
parameters that describe the format of varargs in a function. Potential uses:

- `g_object_new`
- `g_log_structured`
- `soup_server_new`?
- there was some function in the `gupnp` stackâ€¦
